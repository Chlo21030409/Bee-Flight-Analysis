# Bee Flight Analysis
R code to manipulate raw data output from raspberry pi into analysis-ready data set for subsequent analysis

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of an R script that took a raw data output from a raspberry pi into an csv file that was suitable for subsequent downstream data cleaning, manipulation and analysis. The experiment measured the flight distance, duration and velocity of bumblebee flight from a tethered flight mill. Bees were allowed up to three stops before their flight was terminated. This R code was developed to remove any stops and breaks in the data to enable clean and easy analysis of the data to determine the mean distance, duration and velocity of flight, and perform further statistical analysis to answer the scientific hypotheses of the project.
